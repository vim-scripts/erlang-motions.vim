Motions

    ]] go to next function declaration
    [[ previous function declaration

    ]m next function clause
    [m previous function clause

    And more: ]M, [M, ][, [] go to end of next/previous clause/declaration.

    Each motion can be prefixed with a count.

Text objects

    im, am inside/around function clause

    iM, aM inside/around function declaration

To remind yourself what's an erlang function clause/declaration:
http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/functions.html

All these additions are consistent with vim's default behaviour (but vim's default behaviour doesn't work on erlang).
